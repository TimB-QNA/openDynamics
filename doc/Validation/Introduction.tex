\chapter{Introduction}
This document details the tests undertaken to validate openDynamics. This document is very much a work in progress, so it is not guaranteed that it is in any way complete. The aspiration is that this document will cover both unit testing of all the components used in the simulation, as well as broader verification of the results against manouvring and seakeeping tests on published hullforms.
